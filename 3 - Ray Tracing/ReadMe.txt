Ray Tracing
***********

This assignment is about Ray Tracing.
The goal of this assignment is to make our own Recursive Ray Tracing.
You'd better use the release mode as some images can take a long time to be rendered.
Besides, include in your release folder FreeImage.dll.
In order to test you can use the images in testscenes or submissionscenes in the command line.
Including glm-0.9.2.7 would be necessary.
